# Disease-Transmission-Analysis-Toolkit

Because social behavior follows temporal patterns in that the order of contact matters, temporal networks are more accurate than static networks in modeling and understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases. However, not many tools are currently available to aid researchers studying temporal networks because these tools are harder to develop. This project attempts to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly and flexible framework that researchers can use to simulate disease data, identify patterns, and extract actionable visualizations. This information will enable them to better understand how to control and hopefully prevent future disease epidemics. 

This project was developed under the mentorship of Dr. Shweta Bansal and Dr. Ewan Coleman from the Bansal Lab at Georgetown University.
